BUT, the terabytes of data have not been translated into information, let alone insights. Sadly, those minimally processed data have overwhelmed and burned out physicians, leading to errors. The key to harvesting the useful insights is understanding the mental model of physicians. Dr. Tang is Adjunct Professor of Medicine in the Clinical Excellence Research Center at Stanford and a practicing internist at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. In this workshop, he will help you understand the problem-solving mental model of physicians managing patient care as a basis for making care safer.",

Predicting whether a startup idea will work or not is notoriously difficult, and the best way to evaluate it is to quickly build something and test it out. That said, at this point with so much data + experience, we can roughly put ideas into 2 groups: ones worth trying, and ones that are very unlikely to work out.  Come to our workshop to learn how to identify viable startup ideas, and begin to think about how to come up with them yourselves!",
