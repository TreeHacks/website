  "challenges_intro": "TreeHacks 2022 will be the 8th-ever iteration of TreeHacks. Our theme is hacking for the future: addressing deeply impactful problems and building creative, unique solutions. We’ve identified five global and technological challenges that we think have tons of potential for innovation. Across each of these challenges, we’ve scaffolded resources like potential project ideas, data sets, APIs and toolkits, and more to help get you get started. There isn't a strict guideline for what you should work on, but here are some of our focus areas:",

      "description": "Silicon Valley moves quickly, but at the same time, innovators have come to recognize the importance of not breaking things in the pursuit of growth. We need hackers – literal hackers – to rise to the challenge of protecting privacy, security, and free expression on the web. We must also work to preserve trust and safety on the web, mitigating the potential for these protections to be misused by bad actors."

      "logo": "images/challenges/web3.png",
      "description": "We are in the midst of an exciting transition to a more open and fair way of participating in activities on the internet. The Web 3.0 challenge asks hackers to think about how decentralization fits into their thesis of the future and how we can leverage technology to move towards systems in which we don’t concentrate power in the hands of a few."

      "name": "accessibility",
      "logo": "images/challenges/community.png",
      "description": "Technology is growing at an exponential rate, but is it empowering every person in the same capacity? The accessibility challenge encourages hackers to develop new ways to enable all people, regardless of background or ability, to fully interact with modern technologies. This helps ensure that technology is lifting society as a whole rather than widening existing disparities."
