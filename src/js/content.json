Our theme this year is hacking for the future: addressing deeply impactful problems and building creative, unique solutions. We’ve identified six global and technological challenges that we think have tons of potential for innovation. Across each of these challenges, we’ve scaffolded resources like potential project ideas, data sets, APIs and toolkits, and more to help get you get started. There isn't a strict guideline for what you should work on, but here are some of our focus areas.",
