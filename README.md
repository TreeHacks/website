Finally got at least the local development version working!
### Install Dependencies
Use
```
npm install
```
to install the necessary dependencies for the project. You should see now see the node_modules folder in the root directory.
### Run Locally
Use
```
npm run dev
```
to automatically bundle files as you modify them. In a separate command line window, enter
```
npm start
```
to start the server. At this point, you can see go to http://localhost:3000 in a browser and see the site. You'll probably need to refresh if you changed files to see the changes.
